# Mother Earth
 Mother Earth has been developed as part of Code Institute's April 2022 Hackathon.
Mother earth helps you plan for a more sustainable future in a playful way through simple tips, quiz, events, rewards.
By raising self-awareness we can enable peole to reconnect to themselves ,reconnect to nature and truly comprehend humanity's impact on the planet by creating
a quiz app feature, tree planting donation feature and some extra resources.
The team members for this project were: Nigel Doberer, Salwin Achankunju_5P, Yusuf F, Jochen Mayer, Eugenia Musat & Sandra Atino under the guidance of our facilitator, DaveHorrocks_ci.

### Images
 * All images used are from pexels ,freepik , Canva and are free to used for educational purposes.


### Typography

 [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to select the fonts.
  * The main font used throughout the site are'ubuntu', 'Abril+Fatface, Ibmplex & Monserrat The font is clean and elegant, making it a good choice for web design.

 * We have used the 'Abril + Fatface' font for titles and headers all over the site.


## Technologies
### Backend functionality
The backend functionality is realized with a combination of Flask, MongoDB and custom made APIs.
The first API endpoint is GET /places which returns a JSON structure containing data from quiz_rewards MongoDB collection.
The second API endpoint is POST /places which receives JSON data from JS and stores the data in the quiz_rewards MongoDB collection.

After the visitor completes the quiz, he/she will land on the /score page.

In there he/she will need to give a name for the tree and choose a location by clicking on the map.

After that, when clicking ```Send```, the JS client side functionality will send a POST API request to /scores containting data about name, latitude, longitude, score.

The backend will store that data in MongoDB.

After calling the POST API, the user is redirected to ```Plant a tree``` view.

The /plant_tree view displays a map showing all the locations where quiz visitors planted the trees.
This is done by a JS functionality which obtains data from GET /score API endpoint and puting pins on the map.

## Deployment

#### Requirements 
- Python3 
- Github account 
- MongoDB account 
- Heroku account

#### Clone the project 
To make a local clone, follow the following steps. 
1. Log in to GitHub and go to the repository. 
2. Click on the green button with the text **"Code".**
3. Click on **"Open with GitHub Desktop"** and follow the prompts in the GitHub Desktop Application or follow the instructions from **[this link](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository#cloning-a-repository-to-github-desktop)** to see how to clone the repository in other ways. 

#### Working with the local copy
1. Install all the requirements: Go to the workspace of your local copy. In the terminal window of your IDE type: **pip3 install -r requirements.txt**.
2. Create a database in MongoDB  
    - Signup or login to your MongoDB account.
    - Create a new Database called "mother_earth" in [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/). .
    - In the "mother_earth" database create the **quiz_rewards** collection.
        ###### quiz_rewards
        ```
        {
            _id: <ObjectId>,
            name: <String>,
            lat: <Decimal>,
            lng: <Decimal>,
            score: <Integer32>,
        }
3. Create the environment variables 
    - Create a .gitignore file in the root directory of the project.
    - Add the env.py file in the .gitignore.
    - Create the file env.py. This  will contain all the environment variables.
    ```
    import os
    os.environ.setdefault("IP", "Added by developer")
    os.environ.setdefault("PORT", "Added by developer")
    os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "Added by developer")
    os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_URI", "Added by developer")
    os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DBNAME", "Added by developer")
    ```
4. Run the app: Open your terminal window in your IDE. Type python3 app.py and run the app.

#### Heroku Deployment  
1. Set up local workspace for Heroku 
    - In terminal window of your IDE type: ```pip3 freeze -- local > requirements.txt.``` (Heroku detects this as a Python app. The reason that they've been able to detect Python is because we have a requirements.txt file)

    - In terminal window of your IDE type: ```echo "python app.py" > Procfile``` (The file is needed for Heroku to know which file is needed as entry point.)
1. Set up Heroku: create a Heroku account, create a new app and select your region. 
2. Deployment method 'Github'
    - Click on the **Connect to GitHub** section in the deploy tab in Heroku. 
        - Search your repository to connect with it.
        - When your repository appears click on **connect** to connect your repository with the Heroku. 
    - Go to the settings app in Heroku and go to **Config Vars**. Click on **Reveal Config Vars**.
        - Enter the variables contained in your env.py file. it is about: **IP, PORT, SECRET_KEY, MONGO_URI, MONGO_DBNAME**
3. Push the requirements.txt and Procfile to the repository. 
     ```
    $ git add requirements.txt
    $ git commit -m "Add requirements.txt"

    $ git add Procfile 
    $ git commit -m "Add Procfile"
    ```
4. Automatic deployment: Go to the deploy tab in Heroku and scroll down to **Automatic deployments**. Click on **Enable Automatic Deploys**. By **Manual deploy** click on **Deploy Branch**.

Heroku will receive the code from Github and host the app using the required packages. 
Click on **Open app** in the right corner of your Heroku account. The app wil open and the live link is available from the address bar. 


### Forking the GitHub Repository
The repository can be forked on GitHub, this creates a copy of the repository that can be viewed or amended without affecting the original repository. This can be done using the following steps:

- Login to GitHub and locate the repository as before.
- At the top right of the repository (under your avatar) locate the Fork button and click this button.
- There should now be a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account, which you can amend.

### Cloning the GitHub Repository
A clone of the repository can be made, which will create a local copy on your own computer. Changes can be made to this local copy and it will not affect the original repository. Follow these steps to clone the Sunrise Yoga repository.

- Login to GitHub and locate the repository as before.
- Click the button called "Code".
- Under HTTPS copy the link provided, in this case ().
- Go to Gitpod or whichever IDE you are using and open the Terminal.
- Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
- Type 'git clone' followed by the url you copied in step 3.
- Press "Enter" to create the local clone.
- You can refer to the GitHub documentation for more detailed information on the above process [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
